/**
 * 1 - 
 *      In this exercise we're going to perform an AJAX request using the
 *      {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API Fetch API}
 *      and process the response.
 *      We will use {@link https://httpbin.org/} as the server.
 * 
 *      Your task is:
 *          - Write a function that sends a GET request to {@link https://httpbin.org/status/404}
 *          - If that request responses with a error code (and it will), fallback to a GET request {@link https://httpbin.org/status/200}
 *          - When the request is successful, log something (like the response status) and send a request to 
 *            {@link https://httpbin.org/json} and log the response (parsed as json)
