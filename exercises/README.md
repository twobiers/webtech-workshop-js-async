# Exercises

The exercises are sperated in the three major topics the workshop covered.

1. Callbacks
2. Promises
3. Async / Await

In each directory you find multiple `.js` files where each represents a distinct exercise and the filename indicates the difficulty level of it. A following letter indicates the task variation.
Also you can find the proposed solutions in a separate directory.

| Filename Pattern | Difficulty Level |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| `1-*.js`         | Easiest          |
| `2-*.js`         | Intermediate     |
| `3-*.js`         | Advanced         |
| `4-*.js`         | Hardest          |

In each exerciese file you will find a more detailed description what needs to be done and what caveats the exercise has in a top level comment. 
In some places you might find type definitions within a region block. These provide you some kind of structure for the exercise but also enables auto completion capabilities. 
But you can ignore them if you want to, these are just helpers to make it a bit more convenient.
